# QCHack 2021

The project submission for the **IBM Creative Challenge**

### Team members:
- Esteban Payares
- Vismai Khanderao
- Denis Jankovic

## Goal
Our objective with the project is to present how the phenomena of interference plays a part in the realm of quantum computing through quantum algorithms.

We've introduced this concept in the form of an Jupyter Notebook allowing the reader to be engaged with the content interactively. The notebook can be found in the _[Quackers - final project](https://github.com/PCesteban/QCHACKIBM/blob/main/Quackers%20-%20final%20project/final_INTERFERIBMC.ipynb)_ folder.
